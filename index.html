                <h2>History Of The South African Braai.</h2>
                <p>
                    The word ‘braai’ is a South African favourite term for our beloved tradition of cooking meat over an open flame, 
                    <br>and while there is no argument as to where the word came from, the when is another matter. <br>
                    The word ‘braai’ originated from the Dutch word ‘braden’ meaning ‘roast’ and has since become the word for the social gathering, the grill, <br>and the action of cooking the meat. 
                    It is a word which brings South Africans together across all languages and inspires pride as we gather.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During apartheid, the braai became a symbol of unity and resistance. Non-white communities were often denied access to public parks and beaches, <br>
                    leading them to create their own gathering spots for braais in their backyards and townships. The braai became a source of comfort, cultural preservation, 
                    <br>and community building during this challenging period.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    In 1995, South Africa underwent a historic transformation when Nelson Mandela was elected as the country's first black president. <br>To commemorate this event and celebrate
                    the nation's diverse cultural heritage, National Heritage Day was established. <br>It was on this day that the 24th of September officially
                     became known as "National Braai Day." <br>
                    Today, National Braai Day is a celebration of South Africa's multiculturalism, bringing people from all walks of life together <br>to share a meal cooked over an open flame.
                    It has also spread beyond South Africa's borders, with people around the world joining in the festivities.

                <h3>Boerewors.</h3>
                <p>Boerewors is a type of sausage which originated in South Africa.
                     <br> Boerewors is made from coarsely minced beef (sometimes combined with minced pork, lamb, or both) and spices.</p>
                     <p>
                        To braai boerewors, you cook on low heat for approximately 20 minutes, 10 minutes per side. <br>
                         Turn with tongs and do not pierce with fork during cooking as this releases much of the moisture in the sausage.

                <h3>Beef Steak.</h3>
                <p>A steak is a thick cut of meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, sometimes including a bone.</p>
                <p>To prepare a perfect steak, you have to make sure that it is a room temperperature. <br> You need very hot coals and that your steak is
                     well marinated. The steak should preferably be done medium rare, <br>
                     so you should braai each piece for about 7 minutes, 2 minutes on each side then 1.5 minutes on each side again.
                     <br> Avoid using a fork as this will result in your steak losing juices and making your steak dry.
